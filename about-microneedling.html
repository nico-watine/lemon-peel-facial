Microneedling stimulates your skin's natural ability to repair itself. It enhances this ability by helping to produce new collagen and elastin for healthier, younger-looking skin.

This repair process is accelerated through Microneedling by creating microscopic channels, which also allow products to penetrate into the deper layers of the skin. New collagen and elastin production can reverse years of sun damage, improve acne scars and enhance the overall appearance of aging skin.

Microneedling is extremely versatile and can be used most effectively on the lips and cheeks. The process allows for invidualized settings, making the treatment quite comfortable for most patients. The procedure typically takes 15-30 minutes, depending upon the size of the area and the severity of skin dmage.
