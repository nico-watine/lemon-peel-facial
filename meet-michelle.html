[two_third]I have been a practicing nurse here in the Houston area for the last 25 years, and in the last 12 of those years, I have also been involved in the research and sales of several skin care products. Skincare became a passion of mine, and six years ago I became a licensed esthetician, developed Lemon Peel Facial, and have been providing related services ever since.

I believe that client education is fundamental to skincare, and I teach my clients how to play an active role in taking care of their own skin. I am fully aware of how inundated the customer can become with the constant advertising of the “best product” or “latest trends” in skincare, but it comes down to knowing your own skin, and choosing the skincare regimen that best works for you. It is a joy to work with my clients in evaluating their skin and customizing a day-to-day skincare regimen that meets the client’s skin type, lifestyle, and budget.

Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to meeting you and helping you put your best face forward![/two_third] [one_third_last]<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-865" src="http://cdn.studionclient.rocks/project/lemonpeelfacial/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Michelle.jpg" alt="Michelle" width="500" height="775" />[/one_third_last]
