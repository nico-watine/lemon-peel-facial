Dermaplaning is a safe, simple, and quick procedure that results in the exfoliation of the epidermis and the removal of fine vellus hair (peach fuzz). Results are accomplished via a scalpel and delicate, feathering strokes. Dermaplaning is a great procedure for those that have an excess of vellus hair on the face, a subsequent occurrence to aging. Because an excess in this facial hair leads to a buildup of dirt and oil in the follicles, dermaplaning also serves to create a more smooth and even complexion.

Each dermaplane session is followed by a superficial chemical peel that serves to better correct issues of fine lines and wrinkles, superficial hyperpigmentation, and dry skin. This is done because once the skin has been dermaplaned, it is better adapted to receive such a treatment with the newly exfoliated epidermis and in the absence of facial hair.
